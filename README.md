## MCP3428 API

This module provides a C++ API for communicating with the MCP3428 series of ADCs over I2C, currently implemented for Raspberry Pi.

It makes use of the I2Cdev module, which provides access to the I2C communication hardware.

The I2C bus accessed can be changed in the MCP3428.h file, where it is currently set to /dev/i2c-1 for use with the Raspberry Pi 3b.
